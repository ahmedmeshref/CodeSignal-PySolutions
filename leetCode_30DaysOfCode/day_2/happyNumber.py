    Is happy takes in a number and returns True if it is a happy number, False otherwise. A happy number
    is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
    sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
    or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
